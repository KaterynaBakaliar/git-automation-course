When I think of you and me
Everything that we could be
I could see a family
Baby in the backseat
Right now it's a fantasy
But I'm thinking that could be us
==============================
I was on fire for you
Where did you go?
I could've died for you
How could you not know?

I can see the light in your eyes
And it keeps on pulling me in (in)
But my hearts a disguise
Only beats to get rid of my sins
